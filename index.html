        <h1 id="top">Topical Talk Beginner's Guide</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the beginner's guide for the <a href="https://talk.economistfoundation.org/festivals/festival-2025/" target="_blank">Topical Talk Festival</a>. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about the Festival, from earning stars to winning the weekly competition. The chapters are organized for your convenience and ease of use.</p>

        <h2 id="what-is">What is "Topical Talk"?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Topical Talk Festival</strong> is an educational event created by <em>The Economist</em> that encourages young people to engage in conversations about global issues featured in the news, connecting them with peers from around the world.</p>

        <h2 id="what-do">What do I do in the Festival?</h2>
        <p>During the Festival, your main goal is to write high-quality comments to earn as many stars as possible. At the end of the Festival, you’ll participate in the <em>Standpoint</em>, where you share your final opinion on a chosen topic. Schools that actively participate and rank on the leaderboard can win prizes. You can find the full list of prizes <a href="https://talk.economistfoundation.org/festivals/festival-2025/awards/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="begin">Where do I begin?</h2>
        <p>To get started, simply begin commenting on topics that interest you or that you feel knowledgeable about. Remember to always prioritize <strong>quality over quantity</strong>, as thoughtful, well-written comments stand out the most.</p>

        <h2 id="earn-stars">How do I earn stars?</h2>
        <p>Stars are awarded for high-quality, original comments. If your comments aren't earning stars, focus on being more original and adding unique insights. Originality increases your chances of being noticed and earning recognition. However, don’t stress too much about stars—write about what genuinely interests you. Enjoy the process rather than trying to optimize every detail.</p>
